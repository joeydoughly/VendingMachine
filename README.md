The following is a list of the tools we generally use
- .Net 6

## Development
Ran out of time but my next step was to finished up the front end work to utilize the APIs to purchase products and return products. I also would of created admin style page that would allow the
user to pull all transaction from the ledger or input an id and pull a specific transation. Since it is a ledger, I didn't feel the need to allow for deletes of transactions as it is important to have all transactions as a paper trail.
Security would also need to be considered for access to the ledger information and any orther admin type actions.
